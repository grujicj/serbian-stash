2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
This product is designed specifically for a single restaurant location. The owner requested that a brand new product is made. This is a stand-alone program, independent from all previously developed programs. The restaurant was not open at the time of product development, therefore this is the first product this restaurant has ever used.
